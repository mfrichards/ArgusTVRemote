## Installing

I plan to release the app soon to the Google Play store, but for anyone who wants to help with testing, Beta releases will be available in the "releases" section of the Github project:

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mrichards957/ArgusTVRemote/releases)

Beta releases have a 30 day expiration date, after which you will have to update to a new release. To install from a GitHub release, you must download the apk file to your device and then click on it via any file manager app to install. You must also enable the setting to "Install unknown apps" or "Allow installation from unknown sources", depending on the version of Android your device is running.
